# Transit-delay-prediction


This work demonstrates a practical example of leveraging and merging open data sources to accurately predict transit delays. The corresponding paper, titled 'Predicting Rail Transit Delays with Machine Learning: How to Exploit Open Data Sources,' is currently in progress.

The main code showcases the utilization of various machine learning methods, including support vector machines (with feature selection and parameter tuning), random forest, gradient boosting, deep neural networks, and linear regression, for transit delay prediction.

The case study focuses on the Canberra Rail System, and the necessary data can be found in the 'Data' folder. Additionally, the release includes the 'Large data' folder, which contains the substantial 'Trip_Update' and 'Vehicle_Update' files.

The 'plot' folder provides graphical representations comparing real and predicted values for different algorithms. It also includes a side-by-side bar graph illustrating three evaluation metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE).

For the merging process, the 'merging' folder contains relevant files, and the resulting file, 'data.xlsx,' is available in the release.

To enhance the assessment of features influencing delays, two additional case studies have been included.
